% AFD_VMODEL ... makes simple polygonal velocity models
%
% vmodout=afd_vmodel(dx,vmodin,vel,xpoly,zpoly);
%
% AFD_VMODEL will superimpose a polygon with a different velocity onto
% the background velocity model.  The background model may be homogenous,
% layered, or as complicated as desired.  The program will return the
% velocity model with the polygon superimposed.
% HINT:  Plot your initial velocity model using imagesc with proper x and z 
% coordinates and then use ginput to pick the points of the polygon with your
% mouse and return the coordinates of the points.   
%
% dx = the bin spacing for both horizontal and vertical (in consistent units)
% vmodin = the 'background" velocity matrix in consistent units
%         the upper left corner is (0,0).
% vel = the velocity within the polygon in consistent units (scalar)
% xpoly = a vector of the x coordinates of the polygon
%       = can be entered in consistent units or bin numbers
% zpoly = a vector of the z coordinates of the polygon
%       = can be entered in consisent units or in bin numbers
%         NOTE:  the program will trace out the polygon
%         in the order of the coordinates entered - the 
%         order of your coordinates can effect the shape
%         of the polygon.
